Policy Proposal - A defensible plan against food insecurity by targeting academic institutions

Canada happens to rank 37th out of 41 HICs for the provision of nutritive food to children (Refer to Paper for Citations)

Lack of proper nutrition continues to threaten childrenâ€™s health, increasing their risk of developing chronic diseases such as CVD, Diabetes, stroke etc. in adulthood.

Supportive environments can play a crucial role in guiding and helping children learn about healthy eating behaviours
